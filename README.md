This project delves into the relationship between study habits and academic performance by examining a dataset titled "Study_Habits." The analysis leverages descriptive statistics, correlation techniques, regression models, and hypothesis testing to uncover patterns and significant predictors of academic success, measured through GPA. The insights generated aim to guide educational strategies and improve study outcomes.
